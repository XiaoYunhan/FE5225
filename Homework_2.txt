### Model Comparison:

When comparing the models, it's clear that the SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models have outstanding performance, significantly outperforming the Logistic Regression model across all metrics. Here's a breakdown of their performance in cross-validation:

- SVM has the highest average accuracy and F1-score and shares the highest ROC-AUC score with Random Forest, making it the top-performing model in this comparison.

- Random Forest is comparable to SVM in terms of ROC-AUC, sharing the highest score and closely following SVM in accuracy and F1-score.

- Decision Tree is also a strong performer, with accuracy and F1-score that are marginally less than SVM and Random Forest but still extremely high. Its ROC-AUC is slightly lower, indicating that it might not perform as well on varied datasets or with different distributions.

- Logistic Regression has the lowest performance among the four models. However, its ROC-AUC score is relatively high, which suggests it still does a good job at ranking predictions and separating the classes but with less precision and recall, as indicated by the lower accuracy and F1-score.
